<h1> Abstract </h1>
<p> This thesis is based on the impacts of the period and the American society on the John Steinbeck's "Of Mice and Men". 
    John Steinbeck was one of the most significant novelist during the "Great Depression" in America and most of his famous works are published 
    in the 1930s and 1940s. The impacts of 1930s were seen clearly in his works like the American dream, migration for a better life, work conditions, class, race and gender. Briefly, in the Of Mice And Men (1937), we see the expectations of American society during the 'Great Depression'. On the other hand, John Steinbeck often uses contradistinctions in Of Mice and Men like poverty and richness, woman and men, black and white, smart and poor-mind, employer and employee to portray us better the American society during the 1930s and 1940s.</p>
<p>As a result, John Steinbeck treated the realities and the problems of the American Society in his novel. This research is aimed to demonstrate the relationships between Of mice and men and the problems of American society during the great depression.</p>

<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>John Steinbeck was one of the most famous novelists of the American literature who was born in California, in Salinas. He lived from 1902 up to 1968. During his life, he contributed a lot of successful works to the literature. He also won the Nobel and Pulitzer prizes as a writer and because of the reflections on the society, some of his famous works are converted to the movies. Steinbeck's novels made into the movies, also his converted novels portray us the power of his works. Most important works of John Steinbeck are inspired from the Great Depression and social issues of America during the 1930s and 1940s like Of Mice and Men and The Grapes of Wrath. Additionally, in his early life he comes from a lower class family and works as a worker in agriculture. Therefore, he conveys the migration, class, race, working conditions as well as the 'American Dream' in Of Mice and Men. However, his novels are ideological, and he gives a special emphasis on the hardships of the working class and the struggles of the American economy.</p>
<p>Through a detailed analysis we will show that the main characters, Lennie and George in Of Mice and Men, are closely related to work conditions for agricultural workers, migration for job opportunities, class system, and the Great Depression in the 1930s and 1940s. They are seen like the mirrors of the American society in the novel. The writer conveys his messages to the reader via the characters, conditions, places and times of the story in Of Mice and Men.</p>
<p>America witnessed the hard times and some social problems at the beginning of the 1930s after the Wall Street Crash. In fact, the American economy was getting better in the second half of the 1920s. People were becoming richer, the technology was improving. The widespread usage of electricity in cities and the radio broadcasts made American people started to listen to the radio programs. Moreover, Ford started to produce the automobiles and paid a huge salary for the employees. All these were under the control. However, Wall Street Bank Crash has been bombed at the end of the 1920s, in 1929. It caused the chaos in the American Society. Most of the American people had been lost their money. Everyone was effected from the economic crisis. The impact of the economic crisis created a big collapse in the American Society. The unemployed numbers were increased in America. The economic situations of the people became destroyed by the Great Depression times. The society was becoming poorer. Everything had been changed suddenly in America. There was no vestige from the 1920s. John Steinbeck also points out the 1930s in his novel. In fact, Lennie and George’s dream shed lights on the American Society’s dream. In addition to this fact, The American people started to migrate to the California like Lennie and George to find a job and make money to reach their dreams. Lennie and George aimed to make their life better without employers and bad work conditions. This aim of them symbolizes the American dream. The migration to Salinas in California was seen as a result of the Great Depression in American society. So, as we witnessed in the novel, Lennie and George migrated to Salinas in California as well. This is another example of the reflection of the time on Of Mice and Men. The writer also pointed out the racism, class, gender, work conditions and migration in the 1930s’ America.</p>
